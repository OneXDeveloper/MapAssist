# IMPORTANT: After changing anything in this file, ensure validity using https://jsonformatter.org/yaml-validator
#
# How to modify this file:
# All lines starting with "#" are comments and are not parsed
#
# Item filters start with a base item, such as "Ring" or "Colossus Voulge"
# A base item should only be listed once in this config
# An item filter can include one or more rules, and rules can specify one or more criteria
#
# The 2nd line of a filter is the start of a new rule for the item being filtered
# New rules always start with a "-" and list one of the 3 criteria below
#
# The 3rd line can either be a new rule, prefixed with "-" or can be additional criteria for the rule started on line 2
# Additional criteria for each rule must be indented to the same level as the rule and must NOT start with a "-"
#
# Filter rule criteria can be one or more of the following:
# Ethereal:
# Qualities:
# Sockets:
#
# Ethereal: is a true/false value
# If set to false, the filter will not alert for ethereal drops of the base item for that rule, but will alert for
# non-ethereal drops in the same rule
#
# Qualities: can be any of the below
# Inferior - Low Quality/Damaged/Cracked etc items
# Normal - White items
# Superior - White items with enhanced stats (dmg/durability for weapons, and defense/durability for shields and armor)
# Magic - Blue items
# Set - Green items
# Rare - Yellow items
# Unique - Gold items
# Crafted - Orange items
#
# Sockets: is a list of the desired number of sockets for the filter to match on, and can include multiple numbers
#
# Example filters and criteria can be found below. The examples are included in the config, please do not uncomment them.
#
# Alert to any unique Shako, regardless of any other criteria
# Shako:
# - Qualities: unique
#
# You can also filter for the base item without any additional rules, such as for boss essences and keys
# Key of Hate:
# Key of Terror:
# Key of Destruction
# Twisted Essence of Suffering:
# Charged Essence of Hatred:
# Burning Essence of Terror:
# Festering Essence of Destruction:
#
# This thresher filter is really 2 rules and one of the rules has 3 criteria.
# This filter will look for ethereal threshers with 0 or 4 sockets that are either normal superior quality
# A second rule is defined to look for any unique Thresher regardless of other criteria
# One thing is importent to note: criteria in one rule do not affect other rules.
# In this case, if The Reaper's Toll drops, the filter will alert you even if it is Ethereal, because the 2
# rules match different criteria. To additionally prevent alerts from Ethereal versions of The Reaper's Toll,
# you would add "Ethereal: false" under the "Qualities: unique" line
# Thresher:
# - Ethereal: true
#   Qualities: [normal, superior]
#   Sockets: [0, 4]
# - Qualities: unique # The Reaper's Toll
#
# This mage plate filter will look for any normal/superior mage plate with 3 or 4 sockets
# This shows an alternate way to define items in a list.
# In this case, "normal" and "superior" both have a "-" prefix. This is treated as part of the above criteria (Qualities)
# and works the same as "Qualities: [normal, superior]" as you see in the example above.
# Mage Plate:
# - Qualities:
#    - normal
#    - superior
#   Sockets: [0, 3]
#
# 3 rules here, notice the "-" on each line
# This will show all magic, rare, and unique monarchs, as well as monarchs with 4 sockets of any quality
# Monarch:
# - Sockets: [0, 3, 4]
# - Qualities: [magic, rare]
# - Qualities: unique # Stormshield
#
# "Any" is a filter which can be used if you would like to see items which match certain criteria regardless of the
# base item type. For example: ALL uniques, all set items, all items with x sockets, etc
# Most of the time we don't want to filter that broadly, so this is commented out with #
# Any:
# - Qualities: [magic, unique]

# This is just an object that holds all our commonly used aliases
# Aliases are labeled by the `&` and then the name
# They are then used by referencing `*` then the name
